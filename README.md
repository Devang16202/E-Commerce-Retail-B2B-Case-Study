## Problem Statement:
Schuster is a multinational retail company dealing in sports goods and accessories
Schuster conducts significant business with hundreds of its vendors, with whom it has credit arrangements. 
Unfortunately, not all vendors respect credit terms and some of them tend to make payments late. 
Schuster levies heavy late payment fees, although this procedure is not beneficial to either party in a long-term business relationship.
Every time a transaction of goods takes place with a vendor, the accounting team raises an invoice and shares it with the vendor. 
Schuster would try to understand its customers’ payment behavior and predict the likelihood of late payments against open invoices.

## Business Objective:
Schuster would like to better understand the customers’ payment behavior based on their past payment patterns (customer segmentation).
Using historical information, it wants to be able to predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from its customers.
It wants to use this information so that collectors can priorities their work in following up with customers beforehand to get the payments on time.

To summarise, as a business analyst, we want to find the answer to these questions:

How can we analyse the customer transactions data to find different payment behaviours?
In which way can you segregate the customers based on their previous payment patterns/behaviours?
Based on the historical data, can you predict the likelihood of delayed payment against open invoices from the customers?
Can you draw any business insights based on your developed model?


Overall, we need to build a model with the primary objective of identifying important predictor attributes that will help the business understand indicators of late payment. You have to recommend the classification model that you would finally deploy for production and explain why you recommend it.
